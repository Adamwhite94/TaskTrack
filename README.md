What Task -> What class -> when is it due -> what time would you like to allocate too it per day/week

organise by classes, and due dates, give a weekly breakdown (maybe look into using some sort of calender api/library)//

Use redux and the example on the react-hook-form website to setup transfer between pages.

this is hurting my brain imma come back to it just need to pass form data in a clean way then display it
